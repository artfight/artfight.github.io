# artfight.github.io
## Testing grounds for Art Fight developers

### Initial Destructions:
1. Make a github account and tell Takaia your username so she can add you to the permissions of this repository
2. Download and install [smartgit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/)
3. Open smartgit and follow initial instructions
4. If initial setup has you clone a repository, enter this address for it: https://github.com/username/username.github.io
5. If you didn't clone the repository with initial setup, click the Repository menu and select Clone from the dropdown. You will keep Remote Git or SVN repository selected and put the url for the repository (given above) in the Repository URL spot, and then click next.
6. go through the steps until you click finish, and ask Takaia if you have any questions. You should now have all of the website files you need on your computer in the directory you selected!
7. Next we will go over some Git stuff together ^^

### Learning resources for stuff you may need to know later
